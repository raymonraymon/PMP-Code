This is a very simple model repair program that is loosely based on the
paper

  P. Liepa.
  Filling holes in meshes.
  In Proc. Symposium on Geometry Processing 03, pages 200–205, 2003.The program reads in triangle mesh, identifies all holes and closes them by
a smooth surface patch. A typical invocation might look like this:

  holefill 3 bunny_with_holes.off bunny_repaired.off

The second parameter describes the stages that the program should run through:
  1 = Produce the minimal triangulation of the holes only.
  2 = Stage 1 + Remesh the fillings
  3 = Stage 2 + Smooth the fillings

You might want to experiment with the program by
- modifying the weighting function
- implmenting a better smoothing algorithm
- implementing Liepa's original remeshing algorithm
